## How I Built My Portfolio Website

### Step 1: Planning and Design
- Started with a clear plan for the content: About Me, Core Skills, Professional Experience, Education, and Contact Info.
- Used a wireframe tool to draft the layout and visualize the structure.

### Step 2: Development
- Created `index.html` for the website's main structure.
- Wrote `styles.css` to define the visual style and ensure a professional aesthetic.
- Implemented `script.js` to enhance user interactivity.
- Organized assets in `Pictures/` and `PDFs_and_PPTs/` directories for images and documents respectively.

### Step 3: Hosting and Deployment
- Selected [Render](https://render.com/) for its ease of use and free tier for hosting.
- Established a GitHub repository and connected it to Render for continuous deployment.

### Step 4: Domain Purchase and Setup
- Acquired a cost-effective domain from [IONOS](https://www.ionos.de/websites/homepage-erstellen) for just 2â‚¬.
- Configured DNS settings in IONOS to direct to my Render-hosted site.

### Step 5: Launch
- Conducted comprehensive testing before going live.
- Completed the entire process from concept to launch within a two-day period.
