# Servando Pizarro Mart√≠nez - Portfolio Website

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio website, a concise showcase of my professional journey and skills. This website was build over a fun, intensive two-day challenge where I pushed the limits of my curiosity in technology and demonstrated my competence in a new field.

## Website Overview

- `index.html`: The core HTML file that defines the structure of the portfolio.
- `styles.css`: The styling file that ensures the website is visually appealing and reflects a professional aesthetic.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the portfolio elements.
- `Pictures/`: A directory containing visual elements of the site, including a professional headshot and project previews.
- `PDFs_and_PPTs/`: A folder hosting my detailed resume and presentations of key projects.

## The Challenge

- **Duration**: 2 days of dedicated effort to go from zero to a fully functional website.
- **Budget**: Limited to 2 euros, invested smartly in a domain purchase from IONOS.
- **Knowledge**: Venturing into an unfamiliar territory with an eagerness to learn and apply new web technologies.

## Development Highlights

- Hosted on [Render](https://render.com/) for its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. 
- Domain acquisition from [IONOS](https://www.ionos.de/websites/homepage-erstellen), ensuring a personalized web address on a shoestring budget.
- Embracing the challenge as a learning opportunity, demonstrating adaptability and growth mindset.
