                <h3>Junior Data Specialist at GIZ in Bonn (2022-Present)</h3>
                <p>
                    In my role as a Junior Data Specialist, I'm not only implementing and programming in Azure Synapse but also innovating with machine learning to improve data efficiency. In bringing together the worlds of Data Science and Data Engineering, my goal is to refine our approach to data, ensuring it’s not only managed but also intelligently transformed into valuable insights. By integrating machine learning with scalable Data Vault techniques, I contribute to advancing our systems towards smart automation and predictive capabilities. Thereby , I will attempt to make make our data strategies not only time-efficient but also future-ready.

                <h3>Dual Student at GIZ in Bonn and Frankfurt am Main (2019-2022)</h3>
                <p>
                    My dual studies at GIZ not only complemented my academic learning but also enriched it with substantial professional experience. Within this role, I bridged the gap between theory and practice, applying university-taught principles to substantial, real-world projects. My involvement in the workers' council and various departments underlined the value of diverse experiences. These three years shaped a comprehensive understanding of digital operations and international project management, laying a solid groundwork for a career enriched by both data and hands-on expertise.                </p>

                <h3>Data Insights in IoT for Pets</h3>
                <p>
                    In this capstone project, I delved deep into machine learning to analyze IoT data from dog trackers. Working with two other students over three months, we aimed to understand pet owner behaviors and enhance device functionality. Our close collaboration with the business taught us about managing requirements and the importance of continuous improvement. We tackled challenges in data processing and interpretation, applying complex ML algorithms for valuable insights.
